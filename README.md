# Design-a-Stack-With-Increment-Operation

Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

Implement the CustomStack class:
CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.
int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.

class Solution:

    def minStickers(self, stickers: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        t_count = collections.Counter(target)
        A = [collections.Counter(sticker) & t_count
             for sticker in stickers]

        for i in range(len(A) - 1, -1, -1):
            if any(A[i] == A[i] & A[j] for j in range(len(A)) if i != j):
                A.pop(i)

        stickers = ["".join(s_count.elements()) for s_count in A]
        dp = [-1] * (1 << len(target))
        dp[0] = 0
        for state in range(1 << len(target)):
            if dp[state] == -1: continue
            for sticker in stickers:
                now = state
                for letter in sticker:
                    for i, c in enumerate(target):
                        if (now >> i) & 1: continue
                        if c == letter:
                            now |= 1 << i
                            break
                if dp[now] == -1 or dp[now] > dp[state] + 1:
                    dp[now] = dp[state] + 1

        return dp[-1]
